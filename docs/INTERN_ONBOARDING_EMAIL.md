## 📚 Start Here (Read in Order)

Before writing any code, please read these documents carefully:

| # | Document | What You'll Learn |
|---|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | `README.md` | Project overview & architecture |
| 2 | `SETUP_GUIDE.md` | How to setup your development environment |
| 3 | `TASKS.md` | Your assignments and deliverables |
| 4 | `CODING_STANDARDS.md` | Code style and naming conventions |
| 5 | `BRANCHING.md` | Branch naming rules |
| 6 | `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` | Commit messages & Git commands |
| 7 | `CONTRIBUTING.md` | How to contribute |
| 8 | `PR_EVALUATION.md` | How your PRs will be evaluated |

💡 **Bonus:** Check `COMMON_MISTAKES.md` to avoid common pitfalls, and `API_EXAMPLES.md` when testing your endpoints.

## 🚦 How to Start

1. **Setup your environment**
   - Follow `SETUP_GUIDE.md` step by step
   - Make sure both backend and frontend run locally

2. **Pick a task**
   - Go to the **Issues** tab
   - Click **New issue**
   - Select the **Task / Feature** template
   - Create an issue for the task you want to work on

3. **Create a branch**
   - Branch from `develop` (not `main`)
   - Use naming convention: `feature/backend-...` or `feature/frontend-...`

4. **Implement & commit**
   - Follow `CODING_STANDARDS.md`
   - Use conventional commits (see `GIT_WORKFLOW.md`)

5. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Target branch: `develop`
   - Fill in the PR template completely
   - Reference your issue: `Closes #XX`

---

## ⚠️ Important Rules

- ❌ **No direct commits to `main` or `develop`**
- ❌ **No API keys in code** (use `.env` files)
- ❌ **No PR without linked issue**
- ✅ **One issue = one branch = one PR**
- ✅ **Self-review before requesting review**
